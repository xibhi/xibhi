## 👋🏻 Hey, I’m Sibhi.

Started programming at the age of 13, I got a keen interest towards cyber security and have explored multiple dimensions of it. I progressively worked on multiple technologies ranging from software to security, which gave me a brief exposure towards the industry. You can contact me for a coffee or to get your idea into code or to consult for your software, security needs.

Beyond hacking, I’m passionate about the intersection of technology and business — particularly Web3, decentralized systems, product strategy, and scaling startups. I thrive where innovation meets execution, whether it’s securing digital infrastructure or building the next disruptive venture.

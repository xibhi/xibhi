# 👋 Hey, I’m Sibhi.
17 y/o, Hacker, CVE-2025-26206, Secured NASA, Cisco, Lenovo, United Airlines, Citi.

## 🚀 About Me:

I break what shouldn’t break and build what resists being broken. No fancy degrees — just instinct sharpened by bugs, binaries, and a need to understand what others fear to touch. I void warranties the way artists ruin blank canvases: deliberately.

## 💼 What I Do:

### 🎨 Design
> I don't just write code - I craft systems. From intuitive user flows to scalable cloud infrastructures, I design software that's elegant under the hood and effortless to use. Your business logic gets translated into a future-proof technical blueprint.

### 💻 Develop
> I turn complex ideas into functional, high-performance software. Whether it's mobile apps, web platforms, or scalable backend systems, I build solutions that work flawlessly under real-world demands.

### 🛡️ Defend
> With 3 years of experience in ethical hacking and penetration testing, I identify vulnerabilities before attackers do. I build resilient systems that keep your data safe from breaches.

### ⚙️ Hustle
> There is no one thing. I hustle a lot to explore opportunities and learn various domains of science, technology and engineering to apply them in my work.

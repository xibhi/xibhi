## ♥️ Hey, I’m Sibhi.

I break what shouldn’t break and build what resists being broken. No fancy degrees — just instinct sharpened by bugs, binaries, and a need to understand what others fear to touch. I void warranties the way artists ruin blank canvases: deliberately.

## 🚀 About Me:

Started programming at the age of 13, I got a keen interest towards cyber security and have explored multiple dimensions of it. I progressively worked on multiple technologies ranging from software to security, which gave me a brief exposure towards the industry. You can contact me for a coffee or to get your idea into code or to consult for your software, security needs.

Beyond hacking, I’m passionate about the intersection of technology and business — particularly Web3, decentralized systems, product strategy, and scaling startups. I thrive where innovation meets execution, whether it’s securing digital infrastructure or building the next disruptive venture.

## 💼 What I Do:

### 🎨 Design
> I don't just write code - I craft systems. From intuitive user flows to scalable cloud infrastructures, I design software that's elegant under the hood and effortless to use. Your business logic gets translated into a future-proof technical blueprint.

### 💻 Develop
> I turn complex ideas into functional, high-performance software. Whether it's mobile apps, web platforms, or scalable backend systems, I build solutions that work flawlessly under real-world demands.

### 🛡️ Defend
> With 3 years of experience in ethical hacking and penetration testing, I identify vulnerabilities before attackers do. I build resilient systems that keep your data safe from breaches.

### ⚙️ Hustle
> There is no one thing. I hustle a lot to explore opportunities and learn various domains of science, technology and engineering to apply them in my work.
